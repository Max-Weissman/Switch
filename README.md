# Switch

A online catalogue for my friends and I to keep track of our electronically owned games that we can share with each other on the Nintendo Switch. 
Uses web scraping technology to grab data about the games, a google firebase database to store the data and an Amazon Ec2 virtual machine for dynamic hosting.
